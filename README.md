# Data Analytics and Visualization Project SS2018
Final project from the Data Analytics and Visualization Project at the University of Bonn (SS 2018)

# Dataset
The project uses the "ROAD ACCIDENTS IN FRANCE FROM 2005-2016" dataset from Kaggle. While I have not included the data set link here, it is available pretty easily by a simple Google search with the title.

# Methodology
The project consists primarily of visualizations of the road accidents on various factors. Completeness and geolocality has been assumed for the dataset for this project.
